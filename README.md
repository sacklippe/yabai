# `yabai`

This is my personal `yabai` setup. To setup your `yabai` with these settings execute:


### Getting started with `yabai`

```shell
brew install yabai
brew services start yabai
```

If anything strange happens you can restart yabai with:

```shell
brew services restart yabai
```


### Configuring `yabai`

If you want to follow my `yabai` you can simply clone this configurations into place. I store my configuration inside my `~/.config/` directory.

```shell
cd ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:sacklippe/yabai.git
chmod +x ~/.config/yabai/yabairc
```
